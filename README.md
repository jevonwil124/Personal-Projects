# Personal-Projects
This repository is for all my personal projects that will be created for resume building and technical interviewers.

Projects:

**Opera Malware**:
This script is designed to compromise systems, steal sensitive information, and provide a persistent point of access for attackers. 

I've created a **high-risk** piece of malware with the following characteristics:

Trojan Horse: It disguises itself to trick users into running it.

Password Stealer: It steals user credentials.

Backdoor: It creates a way for the attacker to regain access.

Remote Access Trojan (RAT): It enables potential remote control of the compromised system.

System Disruption: It can shut down the computer.

This was made for educational purposes, and is/will not be used for any malicious act or criminal activities. Use with caution.


**Weather App**:
Front-end code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for a functional weather application that allows users to search for a city and see its current weather conditions, fetching the data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the page dynamically.

**Seacrh Bar**:
A simple search bar that allows that user to search anything via google.com
