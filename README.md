# Personal-Projects
This repository is for all my personal projects that will be created for resume building and technical interviewers.

Projects:

**Opera Killer**:
I've created a Python script alongside its executable that continuously terminates any running Opera processes on a Windows system by using PowerShell commands; it's designed to run in the background without a visible window, includes error handling and activity logging, and will run persistently until manually terminated.

**Weather App**:
Front-end code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for a functional weather application that allows users to search for a city and see its current weather conditions, fetching the data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the page dynamically.

**Seacrh Bar**:
A simple search bar that allows that user to search anything via google.com
