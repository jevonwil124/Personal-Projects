# Personal-Projects
This repository is for all my personal projects that will be created for resume building and technical interviewers.

Projects:

**Cybersecurity Attack Script: Opera-Triggered Credential Harvester**:
The Python script represents a significant cybersecurity threat. It's designed to automate a series of malicious actions on a target system, effectively compromising its security. Here's how:

**Unauthorized Access**: The script waits for a user to open the Opera browser, indicating potential user activity. It then proceeds to change the user's password without authorization.

**Credential Theft**: The script captures the newly changed credentials (username and password) and saves them to a log file.

**Data Exfiltration**: The script then attempts to send this log file containing the stolen credentials to a remote server, enabling the attacker to gain access to the compromised account.

**System Disruption**: Finally, the script attempts to shut down the computer, further disrupting the user's activity and potentially covering the attacker's tracks.

In essence, the script automates key stages of a cyberattack, from gaining unauthorized access to stealing credentials and exfiltrating data.


**Weather App**:
Front-end code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for a functional weather application that allows users to search for a city and see its current weather conditions, fetching the data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the page dynamically.

**Seacrh Bar**:
A simple search bar that allows that user to search anything via google.com
